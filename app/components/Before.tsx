          while also serving my peers as both a Biology and Writing Teaching
          Assistant. After receiving a B.S. in both Biology and Chemistry, I was
          privileged to help my community as a veterinary technician in gold
          standard animal hospitals for over 2.5 years. While managing animal
          hospitals, I learned full stack web development through the part time,
          remote bootcamp 100Devs. I built multiple projects individually and in
          cross-functional teams and successfully delivered websites to multiple
          clients. After graduating the 100Devs, I went back to my roots. I

          I began teaching again through mentoring and career coaching. Pretty
          quickly, I got my first tech role as a Founding Engineer at a startup.
          That didn't last very long, so I tried it again at another startup...
          and that didn't last very long either. Ahh, startup life ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
