          . Now, I'm leading a teammate! I also like to help out other teams
          where I can to gain more product knowledge and bond with my Clerk
          family. ðŸ’™ For me, people come first. As a BIPOC LGTBQ+ neurodivergent
          Woman in tech, I'm passionate about supporting others, especially
          those from underrepresented groups. My experiences in adversity have
          helped me gain profound perspective and fathomless empathy. Outside of
          tech, I'm a huge music connoisseur with an affinity for electric
          guitars. I love going to live music events with my rave fam. I also
          enjoy reading about philosophy and Roman history, cooking, lifting
          weights, and watching anime.
