            In my final 2 years at Stetson University, I conducted Herpetology +
            Invasive Species research while also serving my peers as both a
            Biology and Writing Teaching Assistant. After receiving a B.S. in
            both Biology and Chemistry, I was privileged to help my community as
            a veterinary technician in gold standard animal hospitals for over
            2.5 years. While managing animal hospitals, I learned full stack web
            development through the part time, remote bootcamp 100Devs. I built
            multiple projects in cross-functional teams. I successfully
            delivered to clients, including a Partnered Twitch streamer's
            e-commerce website, achieving a quarterly increase of 248% in total
            sales, 102% in conversion rate, and 100% in returning customer rate.

            I was leading the creation of an educational technology platform
            with a small bootstrapped startup. I am now looking to bring my
            unique perspective and skillset to a collaborative environment where
            diversity and learning is celebrated. As a Woman of Color in tech,
            I'm passionate about supporting others, especially those from
            underrepresented groups. My experiences with BPD and Autism have
            helped me gain profound perspective and fathomless empathy, and I
            manage a mental health support community called Reach. In my free
            time, I manage a few other communities and you can also find me
            career coaching, mentoring, pair programming, or tinkering with new
            technology.
