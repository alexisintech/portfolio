          In my final 2 years at Stetson University, I conducted Herpetology +
          Invasive Species research while also serving my peers as both a
          Biology and Writing Teaching Assistant. After receiving a B.S. in both
          Biology and Chemistry, I was privileged to help my community as a
          veterinary technician in gold standard animal hospitals for over 2.5
          years. While managing animal hospitals, I learned full stack web
          development through the part time, remote bootcamp 100Devs. I built
          multiple projects in cross-functional teams. I successfully delivered
          to clients, including a Partnered Twitch streamer's e-commerce
          website, achieving a quarterly increase of 248% in total sales, 102%
          in conversion rate, and 100% in returning customer rate.
